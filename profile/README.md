**Netdisco** is a web-based network management tool suitable for small to very large networks. IP and MAC address data is collected into a PostgreSQL database using SNMP, CLI, or device APIs. Some of the things you can do with Netdisco:

* Locate a machine on the network by MAC or IP and show the switch port it lives at
* Turn off a switch port, or change the VLAN or PoE status of a port
* Inventory your network hardware by model, vendor, software and operating system
* Custom reports in the web very easily
* API to search and extract records
* Pretty pictures of your network
